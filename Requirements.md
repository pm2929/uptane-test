(2) Check that it has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the latest Root metadata file. (3) Check that the version number of the previous Timestamp metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this Timestamp metadata file. (4) Check that the current (or latest securely attested) time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this Timestamp metadata file.  |
| [5.4.4.5](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html#rfc.section.5.4.4.5.p.1) |  How to check Snapshot metadata| To properly check Snapshot metadata, an ECU SHOULD: (1) Download up to the number of bytes specified in the Timestamp metadata file, constructing the metadata filename (2) The hashes and version number of the new Snapshot metadata file MUST match the hashes and version number listed in Timestamp metadata. (3) Check that it has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the latest Root metadata file. If the new Snapshot metadata file is not signed as required, discard it (4) Check that the version number of the previous Snapshot metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this Snapshot metadata file. If this Snapshot metadata file is older than the previous Snapshot metadata file, discard it (5) Check that the version number listed by the previous Snapshot metadata file for each Targets metadata file is less than or equal to its version number in this Snapshot metadata file. (6) Check that each Targets metadata filename listed in the previous Snapshot metadata file is also listed in this Snapshot metadata file. (7) Check that the current (or latest securely attested) time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this Snapshot metadata file.  |

(3) Check that the Targets metadata has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the relevant metadata file (Checks for an arbitrary software attack) (4) Check that the version number of the previous Targets metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this Targets metadata file.(5) Check that the current (or latest securely attested) time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this Targets metadata file. (6) If checking Targets metadata from the Director repository, verify that there are no delegations. (7) If checking Targets metadata from the Director repository, check that no ECU identifier is represented more than once  |

| [5.4.4.7](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html#rfc.section.5.4.4.7.p.1)|  How to resolve delegations| All delegations MUST be resolved using the following recursive procedure, beginning with the top-level Targets metadata file : (1) Download the current metadata file, and check it following the procedure in Section 5.4.4.6.  (2) If the current metadata file contains signed metadata about the image, end the delegation resolution and return the metadata to be checked. (3) If the current metadata file was reached via a terminating delegation and does not contain signed metadata about the image, abort the delegation resolution for this image and return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found. (4) Search the list of delegations, in listed order for each delegation: (a) Check if the delegation applies to the image being processed. For the delegation to apply, it MUST include the hardware identifier of the target, and the target name must match one of the delegation’s image paths. (b) If the delegation is a multi-role delegation, follow the procedure described in Section 5.4.4.8.  (c) If the delegation is a normal delegation, perform delegation resolution, starting at step a. (5) If the end of the list of delegations in the top-level metadata is reached without finding valid image metadata, return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found.|
